Regardless of the collaboration method allowed, you must always properly acknowledge the sources you
used and people you worked with. Your professor reserves the right to give you an exam (oral, written,
or both) to determine the degree that you participated in the making of the deliverable, and how well
you understand what was submitted. For example, you may be asked to explain any solution that was
submitted and why you choose to write it that way. This may impact the mark that you receive for the
deliverable.
So, whenever you submit a deliverable, especially if you collaborate, you should be prepared for an
individual inspection/walkthrough in which you explain what every line of assignment does and why you
choose to write it that way.
