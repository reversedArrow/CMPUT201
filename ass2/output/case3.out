Choosing point 0 as the root ...
point 1 has a distance 90 to the tree, parent 0;
point 2 has a distance 170 to the tree, parent 0;
point 3 has a distance 155 to the tree, parent 0;
point 4 has a distance 60 to the tree, parent 0;
point 5 has a distance 100 to the tree, parent 0;
point 6 has a distance 160 to the tree, parent 0;
point 7 has a distance 140 to the tree, parent 0;
point 8 has a distance 100 to the tree, parent 0;
point 9 has a distance 45 to the tree, parent 0;
#Edges of the MST by Primâ€™s algorithm:
